- **Card Probability** - The chance that a given number card will be drawn
- **Deck Reliability** - The chance that your attack damage will be affected positively, negatively, or not at all
- **Card Effect Probability** - The chance that a given effect comes into play during your action
- **Average Damage** - The average damage of an attack given a starting base damage
